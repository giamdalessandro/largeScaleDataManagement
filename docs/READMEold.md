# Projects notes

## Information Integration
Integrate information from one or more sources and obtain a reconciled view of the data. Three main phases:

- **Phase 1: Data Gathering**
  - Select domain of interest;
  - Define task to perform in the domain;
- **Phase 2: Modeling**, define the data integration system describing the domain of interest:
  - source schema;
  - target schema;
  - mapping layer; 
  - queries on the target schema;
- **Phase 3: Implementation**, convert the logical model into software:

### workflow
- source DBs (insight on dataset and heterogeneity)
- source schemas
- global schema
- Global Schema Axioms (keys, foreign keys)
- GAV mapping (declarative) 
- Pentaho implementation
- Queries and results (5/6)
